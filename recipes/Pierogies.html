<h2>This recipe for perogies has been in the family for generations, 
    with a few alterations of course! My grandfather is Polish, and his mother taught my grandmother how to make these delicious dumplings. 
    Serve plain, or with butter, sour cream, bacon, etc. Perfecting the pierogi technique takes time, and after a while, you will develop your own system.</h2>
